# Breast Cancer Classification using Neural Networks

This project uses a neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify tumors in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset as **malignant** or **benign**. The model is trained on features extracted from cell nuclei in digitized images of breast masses.

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset
- **Source**: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html)
- **Features**: 30 numeric features describing characteristics of the cell nuclei.
- **Target**: Binary classification (0 = Malignant, 1 = Benign)

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture
- Input layer: 30 features
- Hidden layers: 
  - Dense(64, ReLU) + Dropout
  - Dense(32, ReLU)
- Output layer: Dense(1, Sigmoid)
- Loss function: Binary Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy on test data
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- ROC Curve and AUC Score
